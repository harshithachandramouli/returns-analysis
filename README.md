# 📦 E-commerce Returns Optimisation – Case Study

This project explores return rate challenges in a simulated fashion e-commerce dataset. Using SQL, Python, and Tableau, I investigated why 36% of orders were returned — costing an estimated **€179K** in lost net sales — and proposed data-backed strategies to reduce return volume by 5–10%.

## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques
- **SQL:** Data modelling, segmentation, cohort & CLV analysis  
- **Python:** EDA, predictive modelling (Random Forest, Logistic Regression)  
- **Statistical Testing:** Chi-squared tests, regression diagnostics  
- **Visualisation:** Tableau dashboard for business stakeholders

## 📌 Key Highlights
- Identified high-return categories (e.g. Shoes: 51%) and customer types (e.g. First-time buyers: 40%)
- Built predictive models (AUC: 0.78) to assess return likelihood
- Modelled business impact of interventions (ROI: 10–15%)
