The Challenge
The analysis uncovered a critical challenge: a 36% return rate, resulting in €179,691 in lost net sales. This alarmingly high figure pointed to serious profitability concerns, particularly in categories like shoes (51%) and lingerie (48%), and among first-time buyers (40%).

Approach
Used SQL for segmentation by product, customer type, and channel.
Conducted Chi-squared tests to validate statistically significant relationships.
Built Random Forest and Logistic Regression models to predict return risk (Random Forest: 76.8% accuracy, AUC 0.78).
Conducted CLV and cohort analysis using SQL window functions.
Utilized Tableau for dashboard creation and visual insights.
Key Insights
Fit-related issues ("Wrong size" and "Fit not right") caused 33% of returns.
Size guide usage significantly reduced return rates.
First-time buyers and TikTok-acquired customers showed the highest return tendencies.
Premium members had the lowest return rates and highest CLV.
Business Impact
Proposed interventions (e.g., sizing tools, better descriptions, marketing optimization) could cut returns by 5–10%.
Scenario modeling showed €25K–€50K net sales recovery per period.
Estimated ROI between 10% to 15% from proposed strategies.
